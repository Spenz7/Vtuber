Vtuber teaching cs content, https://www.youtube.com/@sandantesg

Issue: Currently facing ngrok 1GB bandwidth limit thus I can't access the vc server that long (around 24hrs b4 hitting the 1GB limit)
Solution: Replace ngrok with Cloudflare tunnels (working on this)
Note: Kaggle allows gpu usage of 30hrs/wk which isn't an issue rn

# Software required
1) Vtube studio (prefer this) / Nizima live - live 2D face tracker
  
2) Voice changer w-okada - Kaggle ver as I don't have a proper gpu
  
3) Virtual cable - to use with tgt with the voice changer, https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   
4) OBS - recording software

5) Xournal++ - for annotations

6) Microsoft clipchamp (use if barely any lag in vChanger output) / Davinici resolve (use if avg lag) / Lossless cut (use if severe lag in voice changer output) - for editing recording

# Hardware required
1) Mic - Fifine k669

2) Pen tablet - One by Wacom CTL672
